# REZONA (ONA)

> **Stay in tune.**

REZONA introduces **ONA — Oscillation‑Normalized Agreement**, a commit→slot→reveal + harmonic sequencing design that makes manipulative ordering **uneconomic**. Blocks are valid only when transaction flow respects **micro‑slot ordering** and keeps **Harmonic Loss (HL)** low. Rewards scale by `exp(−HL)`, so honest, well‑tuned blocks pay best.
