# REZONA (ONA)

**A Quantum-Inspired, MEV-Resistant Blockchain with Harmonic Consensus**  
*Whitepaper v0.1 — August 28, 2025*

---

## Abstract
REZONA (ticker **ONA**) is a standalone Substrate blockchain that introduces **QIH — Quantum Information Harmonics**,
a consensus and block-building design that makes **MEV extraction mathematically unprofitable**.
ONA replaces competition for hardware (PoW) or capital (PoS) with **information alignment**:
transactions are staged through a **commit→slot→reveal** flow, then sequenced by **harmonic constraints**
measured with a compact **Harmonic Loss (HL)** function derived from phase/PSD/SNR metrics.
Validators are rewarded by **`exp(−HL)`** (higher resonance → higher payout).

## ONA: Canonical Expansions (Anagram Family)
1. Oscillation-Normalized Agreement — consensus condition  
2. Orchestrated Noise Attenuation — anti-MEV pipeline  
3. Optimal Node Alignment — validator reputation  
4. Order-Normalized Assembly — deterministic micro-slot sequencing  
5. Observational Network Attestation — commit→slot→reveal integrity  
6. Oscillator-Native Accounting — tokenomics bound to cycles  
7. Objective Nonlinear Analysis — phase/PSD features for HL  
8. Orthogonal Noise Annulling — SNR spam filter  
9. Open Network of Agents — ecosystem of apps  
10. On-chain Network Autonomy — governance & upgrades

## Architecture + Consensus (abridged)
Substrate solo chain with BABE (VRF) and GRANDPA finality.
`pallet-qih` governs intake/assembly: Commit → Slot assignment → Reveal →
Order-Normalized Assembly → Harmonic checks → Finalize & reward.

`HL = α Σ ε_phase^2 + β ε_psd^2 + γ (1/SNR)`; rewards scaled by `exp(−HL)`.

See repository README for parameters and roadmap.
