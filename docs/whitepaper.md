# REZONA (ONA)

**A Quantum‑Inspired, MEV‑Resistant Blockchain with Harmonic Consensus**  
*Whitepaper v0.2 — August 2025 (plan + roadmap updated)*

---

## Abstract
REZONA (ticker **ONA**) is a standalone Substrate blockchain that introduces **QIH — Quantum Information Harmonics**, a commit→slot→reveal + harmonic sequencing design that makes **MEV extraction mathematically unprofitable**. ONA replaces competition for hardware (PoW) or capital (PoS) with **information alignment**: blocks are only valid if their transaction flow follows slot constraints and maintains low **Harmonic Loss (HL)** derived from phase/PSD/SNR features. Rewards scale by **`exp(−HL)`**, so honest, well‑tuned blocks pay best.

This revision folds in: (1) clarified validity rules for ordering, (2) an off‑chain fairness interface for CEX/OTC venues (**FSE** + **FFB**), (3) economic levers to make unproven off‑chain flow unattractive, (4) validator hardware/topology guidance, and (5) brand/ops links (repo, site, X).

## ONA: Canonical Expansions (Anagram Family)
1) **Oscillation‑Normalized Agreement** — consensus condition  
2) **Orchestrated Noise Attenuation** — anti‑MEV mempool & sequencing  
3) **Optimal Node Alignment** — validator reputation (RW)  
4) **Order‑Normalized Assembly** — deterministic micro‑slot building  
5) **Observational Network Attestation** — commit→slot→reveal integrity  
6) **Oscillator‑Native Accounting** — tokenomics/issuance breathing  
7) **Objective Nonlinear Analysis** — features for HL (phase/PSD/SNR)  
8) **Orthogonal Noise Annulling** — SNR spam filter  
9) **Open Network of Agents** — ecosystem of apps  
10) **On‑chain Network Autonomy** — governance/upgrades

## 1. Build Philosophy & Deployment Shape
- **Independence:** v1 is a **solo Substrate chain** (BABE VRF authoring + GRANDPA finality).  
- **Path later:** optional Polkadot parachain or bridges; QIH lives in the runtime and follows us.  
- **Why solo:** faster iteration on QIH parameters (W, Δ, ε, α/β/γ, τ) and economics.

## 2. Architecture Overview
**Pipeline:**
1) **Commit**: users submit `C = H(tx)` plus VRF ticket `π`.  
2) **Slot assignment**: with randomness `R_t`, map to micro‑slot `s = F(π, R_t) mod W` for block *t+1*.  
3) **Reveal**: open `tx`; validators check `H(tx)=C` and slot eligibility `(s ∈ ±ε)`.  
4) **Order‑Normalized Assembly**: builder sweeps slots in order `0..W−1`; no cross‑slot jumps.  
5) **Harmonic checks**: compute **HL** over phase/PSD/SNR.  
6) **Finalize & reward**: block valid iff `HL ≤ τ`; reward `= base · exp(−HL)`.

**Validity means ordering:** if a tx appears outside its slot window or the block’s HL exceeds `τ`, the block is invalid. Within a slot, co‑eligible txs may be fee‑sorted with adjacency guards.

## 3. Harmonic Loss (HL)
We model recent state‑diffs as a signal and penalize manipulative patterns:
```
HL = α · Σ_s Σ_tx∈slot(s) ε_phase(tx,s)^2
   + β · ε_psd(block)^2
   + γ · (1 / SNR(block))
```
- **Phase error:** compare tx placement to a smooth baseline phase curve.  
- **PSD distance:** compare the block’s power spectral density across slots to an expected distribution.  
- **1/SNR penalty:** spam and jitter lower SNR.

Two modes: hard validity (if `HL>τ` reject) and reward shaping (`reward *= exp(-HL)`).
